


            When the language

             underneath our


         words starts to fold or


                       rot, we get

                    meaning compost.

                The peels

                             and seeds of
            hypothesis we discard,

                                 break

         down into microcosmic games, elastic combinations of waves.







      None of the unconscious we spit out when we speak

      disappears.

 Autonomous products and particles of the mind follow


               a cycle
               like water, and sunlight, and every other
               fruit of the Earth.




Earthworms will come to reclaim every sentence,

fungi will grow over everything our senses touch.

Earthquakes are nothing

for sugarcane ghosts.



They sit still through the movement

and write conjurations:


Water children are casting dreams

lines on the land hurt like butcher marks 

on live animals. Purificatory baths 

won’t serve as explanations. 


Compassion stones, don’t emigrate.


Harvesting flowers is still plausible
we’ve planted riddles like seeds.



Money may stops herbs from

walking up and down the continents

but not from the pursuit of

breaking through concrete sidewalks, bursting

open empty treasure homes.

Arousing the discoveries of vanity, they desire everybody.



Who are they? Never been to the regions where the wind sprouts, wasps caress them as they walk about the country, as they sit still


mindless, in front of the microscope, stringing thoughts for the crows, kissing knives, feeling superstitious of eggs, of dresses, of fluids, of frogs.



The transition was vulnerability and softness, submission to the erotic and the mannerisms, a swallowing of the generosity of strangers. To speak of envy of the artifacts of hormones or to fixate on surgeries would be a perverse objectification.



They will miss the cisgender avoidances, the pleasurable disgust at physiology.



Now they undress, guided by the drive of piloerection, to the thought of osmolality, and touch.



They side with potatoes, peppers, and other independent thinkers and sorters, uprooting the death warnings that suck the crickets out of our blood.

There’s a new theory of paranoia: To please is to seduce a neurosis, to touch your own diagram, to measure the distance from your its nerve to your stria. At six in the morning pupils are nothing but undulating patterns of dust. It isn’t ontology, just incubators for existential thoughts on the sociocultural structures of consciousness. Something to mitigate the moody desires of the kernels of truth we loan as performance. Commitment to the ludicrous paradoxes of humor, to the guts viciously pressured by the ink of the tattoos. Biological extinction would unleash some garish psychic operations.

We have managed to
                     grow in all
                                directions and still
                                                    
                          have plenty of everywhere around us
                           
                       
bottomless vanishing points
                          to be alone in, to remember
                          
                the folds between us and the other images that grow,
                

the combinations of sounds that encode
                                     common beliefs, the drops of water
                                     
                                   sliding down windows, the yellow leaves
                            
                            responding to the wind with a switch in point of view.


We went off thinking
                     we knew ourselves, then
                                              
                               came back translated, we now
                                                                         
                       collaborate with fellow lumps of glass to cook
                       
                                  dishes better than we’ve been getting,
                         befriending the birds,
                                           harvesting the salts,
                                                           placing an onion 
                                                           under our beds.

The moon found them pouring scalding water through an incision
in the intestinal membrane.



Where before a kindly constellation, an abandoned planet with miscellany habits

now nothing but a carcass; arteries haphazardly parboiled.



Nearby insects wore a veil of skin and ashes, unwanted entrails and fibers lay there

like an abandoned house.


Perhaps the animal should have emigrated to another planet, one

where the atmosphere may help one believe with conviction in mold, and sage, and death.


Not this one where evidence funerals and dirt could mean

nothing to them.
