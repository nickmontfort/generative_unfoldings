### Seedlings:From Humus

<i>Seedlings:From Humus</i> is a digital ecosystem within which human and machine writers can collaborate in caring for linguistic seedlings composed of language. Words act as seeds planted in different contextual soils, and an algorithm helps them to flourish by finding semantically or phonetically related words to create plant-inspired textual structures.

Natural Language Processing algorithms learn from language that has been in constant use and change for thousands of years. Most generative literary artworks are one-way flows where algorithms take source text as input and use it to generate new content. This piece, in contrast, proposes a cycle of collaboration at the core of the creative process: Inspired by both initial and generated texts, participants are encouraged to dislocate and recontextualize words and concepts, transforming the browser into a landscaped garden for the creation and symbiotic development of linguistic migrants.
