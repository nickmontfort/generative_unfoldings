# This Indignant Page: Politics of the Paratextual, 2021
## by Karen ann Donnachie & Andy Simionato
### Artists’ Statement
This Indignant Page is an empathic reading machine which combines sentiment analysis and natural language processing, to generate pages of text and image which attempt to 'illuminate' (and resignify) the emotional sphere of the reader.

The ubiquitous presence of automated reading and writing tools (from auto-correct and -complete, grammar assistance and text prompts, to conversational agents using speech recognition and synthesis) has contributed to what has been described by Marshall McLuhan, among others, as a 'post-literate' society. These tools, together described as 'natural language processing' (NLP), are rapidly shaping (and distorting) systems of language production and dissemination. Yet a true 'understanding' of human sentiment, arguably a central impulse underpinning the production of human language, remains an elusive goal for artificial language systems (and humans alike).

In an attempt to escape this techno-determinism, which is rapidly colonising contemporary consciousness (and shaping our understanding of the world), this work offers a possible way out by bridging existing literary texts to the unconscious world of the reader.

### Project description
This Indignant Page, 2021 is an automated-art-system which attempts to algorithmically generate “illuminated” readings of texts and speech based on both sentiment and semantic analysis. We describe this process as a form of “artificial illumination” in order to link medieval scribal practices with questions concerning emerging technologies such as A.I. and Machine Learning, bridging the pre-literate and post-literate societies.

Original texts in this iteration of the artwork are taken from the Gutenberg archive of books. The algorithm uses sentiment analysis to identify words of significant emotional impact, and combines these values with a number of other parameters based on the text’s semantic meanings and functions in order to determine the page’s paratextual elements (typography, word, paragraph and page-space, and decorative elements). The text can be removed leaving only a visual map of these paratextual elements. 

### How to use
Once launched the artwork will cycle automatically through randomly selected excerpts of any text files found in the ../data/books folder. There are a number of additional functionalities accessible through the following key inputs; these are useful for debugging or simply for fun.
#### Keystroke functions:
* Click/tap = toggle text view on/off [default is text after image]
* Spacebar = force generate new page [default is auto-advance]
* n = download single page as high-res PNG with didactic txt file 
* m = download double-page as high-res PNG with didactic txt file

### Some notes on the code
The project is written using [p5.js](http://p5js.org), based on Javascript/HTML5. 
Additionally this work utilizes the following external libraries and functions:
* P5 sound library: p5sound.js
* RiTa Natural language processing library
* Affin_165 and Vader sentiment analysis dictionaries

The authors are grateful to the administrators, coders, and designers of these resources & libraries.

### Meaning of the title and other influences

> *Children of the future age,*<br/>
> *Reading this indignant page,*<br/>
> *Know that in a former time*<br/>
> *Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.*<br/>
> – first stanza of "A Little Girl Lost" from *Poems* by William Blake (1789)

The title *This Indignant Page* is taken from a poem by artist William Blake. The poem describes the conflictual relationship between social rules and human behaviours. Our work deliberately re-imagines the combinatorial rules of poetry and more generally written language.  

The poem is also an example of Blake’s highly distinctive practice of blending word and image through a technique he called 'illuminated printing'. A term which evokes the 'illuminated manuscripts' produced (mostly) in medieval Western Europe. Blake’s 'illuminated-books' went beyond their medieval antecedents however, as they were individually printed and considered unique versions, rather than copies, of an original.

Another important influence for this work is Marcel Broodthaers' Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard (A throw of the dice will never abolish chance), 1969. Broodthaers’ derivative work redacted (blacked out) all the words on Stephan Mallarmé’s original poem/book of the same name, first published in 1897. Both Mallarmé's original, and Boodthaer's derivative work, are considered ground-breaking examples of the creative use of page-space to influence the production of meaning, and potentially generate novel non-semantic meanings. In 2015, we made our own version of Mallarmé's poem/book automatically replacing Mallarmé's words with Google-generated reCaptcha images: http://athrowofthedicewillneverabolishchance.com/

### Final notes on the Politics of the paratextual
This artwork forms part of a broader series of works which together propose new ways of approaching traditional relationships between written language and human emotion.

Today, AI driven communication is the result of centuries of increasing standardisations and efficiencies, impulses which find their origins with typefaces such as the Romain du Roi. The Romain du Roi, commissioned by King Louis IV of France in the 1600s, has been described as the first custom corporate typeface. Every stroke in this early Western typeface was required to follow strict geometric reasoning in an attempt to diminish the influence of the human hand, considered “vulgar” at the time.

This series of works attempt to disrupt the machinic logic colonizing contemporary typographic space. By reconfiguring the topographies of written language, generative design and machine learning, we explore how geometries of letter-, word- and page-space are far from neutral parameters to language. Instead they hold potentials for imagining new worlds.

### Artists’ Bio
Donnachie and Simionato are an artist duo working in the expanded fields of computational art and design since the 1990s. Their artworks and designs have won the highest international awards and critical recognition in their fields, and have been featured in a number of major publications and international press. They received the Tokyo Type Directors Club Award in 2019 for a robotic-scribe that writes every tweet by Donald Trump and again in 2020 for their AI generated books. One of these books, generated after an AI reading of M.D.Vernon’s Psychology of Perception, received the Cornish Family Prize for Art and Design Book Publishing, the most significant award of its kind. In 2020, they were awarded the Robert Coover Award for Electronic Literature.
