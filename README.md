## Generative Unfoldings

This is a repository for all free/libre/open-source code underlying the [Generative Unfoldings](https://generative-unfoldings.mit.edu) exhibit hosted by MIT, March 2021-.

Some very minor alterations were made to the code for the particular web hosting situation of the exhibit.

This repository is not maintained by the curator of the exhibit, but he has migrated it to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nickmontfort/generative-unfoldings) and considers that to be the central one.
